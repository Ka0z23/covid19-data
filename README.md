## Older historical data

For 2020-03-09 and before, [CCSEGISandData](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports) was tracking US county-level information. They switched to state-level starting on 3/10.

## The source

The data comes from [this](https://facts.csbs.org/covid-19/covid19_county.csv) CSV file, which is maintained by [CSBS.org](https://www.csbs.org/information-covid-19-coronavirus). It's the data file behind their interactive county-level map.

CSBS originally announced their interactive map effort [on twitter](https://twitter.com/CSBSNews/status/1238620548407705602).
